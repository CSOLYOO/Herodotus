# Herodotus - Herodotus the Modpack Backstory
## Prologue
"The darkling skies and yellow earth, amid great chaos had their birth."

"God said, let there be light."

"Then Sun and Moon their courses ran, then stars were set and round they span."

"To be or not to be, that is the question."

"I did not cherish it, and only after I lost it did I regret it, there is nothing more painful in the world than this."

"Guo du zi fu, xu rong he que fa ze ren gan, shi wo men zhe ge chuang zuo zhe she qu quan zi zui da de yi han."

Voices, countless voices were whispering in my head.

I pretended not to hear them, then opened my eyes.

It felt like woken away from a deep illusion,  I pinched myself hard on my left arm.

So real was the pain came after it.

It was real, I was not dreaming.

But those voices, was still springing in my head.

The world was born from the hands of God. NÃ¼wa made humans out of clay.

Herodotus recounts the wonderfully obscure story of the world. Shakespeare portrays the complexities and depths of human nature.

Franklin caught lightning with a kite. Maxwell captured light waves with equations.

ENIAC tubes whispering. The super-dimensional computer's air-cooled system rumbles and roars ---

These characters, events, or rather concepts, and their connotations and extrapolations.

They were once so real to me, but now I only feel their strangeness and absurdity.

I pretended I didn't hear the voices in my head, and stood still and gazed into the distance.

Beneath the deep black dome covered with stars, there was a field of light and color.

A straight river flowed past me, softly emitting the sound of water.

I walked towards the riverbank, picked up a stone.

I found that it had a perfect symmetrical geometric body, shining with a dazzling, attractive light.

I casually tossed the stone into the river, then saw it changed itself to a geometric object of another color.

Insane reality, insanely real. I said to myself.

With an abrupt incredulity to the world around, I once again pinched.

The pain came from the left arm, makes me feel distinctly real.

It was real, I wasn't dreaming.

The rumbles that coming from my stomach, seemed to emphasize this indisputable fact once again.

I was reminded of the philosopher's three ultimate questions.

"Who am I?"

"Where am I?"

"What's for lunch today?"

It's sure to give it a little think about where am I going, perhaps, but not until the lunch is consumed.
