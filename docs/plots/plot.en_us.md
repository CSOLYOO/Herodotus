# Herodotus - Herodotus the Modpack Backstory
## Prologue
"The darkling skies and yellow earth, amid great chaos had their birth."

"God said, let there be light."

"Then Sun and Moon their courses ran, then stars were set and round they span."

"Survival or destruction, that is the question."

"I did not cherish it, and only after I lost it did I regret it, there is nothing more painful in the world than this."

"Guo du zi fu, xu rong he que fa ze ren gan, shi wo men zhe ge chuang zuo zhe she qu quan zi zui da de yi han."

Voices, countless voices were whispering in my head.

I pretended I didn't hear them, then open opened my eyes.

It was like I was woken up from a giant dream, I pinched myself hard on my left arm.

But then the pain that came, was so real.

It was real, I was not dreaming.

But the voice in my head, was still springing in my mind.

The world was born from the hands of God. NÃ¼wa made humans out of clay.

Herodotus recounts the wonderfully obscure story of the world. Shakespeare portrays the complexities and depths of human nature.

Franklin caught lightning with a kite. Maxwell captured light waves with equations.

ENIAC tubes whisper. The super-dimensional computer's air-cooled system rumbles and roars -

These people, events, or rather, concepts, their connotations and extrapolations

They were once so real to me, but now I only feel their strangeness and absurdity.

I pretended I didn't hear the voices in my head, and stood still and gazed into the distance.

Beneath the deep black dome covered with stars, there was a field of light and color.

A straight river flowed past me, softly emitting the sound of water.

I walked towards the riverbank and picked up a stone.

I found that it had a perfect symmetrical geometric form, shining with a dazzling and attractive light.

I casually tossed the stone into the river, only to see it change its color and shape to a geometric form of another color.

It was crazy reality, so real it was crazy. I said to myself.

I suddenly wondered about the world around me.

I once again pinched myself hard on my left arm.

The pain that came from my left arm was sore and real.

It was real, I wasn't dreaming.

The rumbles coming from my stomach seemed to emphasize this indisputable fact, once again.

I was reminded of the philosopher's three ultimate questions.

"Who am I?"

"Where am I?"

"What's for lunch today?"

Perhaps after dinning, I'll give a little think about where I am going next.
