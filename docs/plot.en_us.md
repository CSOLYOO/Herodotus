· Truth and Lies

"People call us heathens, the alternative.

"What we believe to be true was, for them, a false story.

"The advance ship, Herodotus I, was made of despair and set out with hope.

"The Herodotus project was named after the great Herodotus. 
Its purpose was the same as Herodotus himself - to preserve the magic, the so-called unreal history.

"After the departure of Herodotus I, seventeen other Herodotus ships left Earth between the 1730s and the 1740s. 
They carried with them most of the believers of the magical pantheon on Earth. 
Their departure was very secret, but still twelve Herodotus ships were destroyed. 
Only six of Herodotus' arks remained, and they drifted deep into the universe.

· Overflowing Light

"I was awakened by my companion. According to her, we were already in the orbit of another planet. 
But, as I looked out the window, I asked myself: Is this really a planet?

"The first thing that struck me about this "planet" was that it was "full of light". 
Its surface seemed to be a patchwork of huge oceans and land, like a mirror reflecting everything in space, even the six "Herodotus" ships. 
However, the mirror-like surface of the planet has black gaps, dividing the land and ocean into almost perfect two-dimensional geometry.

"The priests of the temple called the planet "Mirror Star", but I thought "Mercury" was a more accurate description of this place - 
it was like a droplet of mercury floating in the universe, reminding me of my childhood. 
When I had a fever, I accidentally broke the thermometer.

"I was almost certain that the Mirror Star was an artificial object.
Therefore, it was no longer surprising when we found minerals of different shapes and colors and saw the miracle produced by mixing them with each other. 
The first step of the Herodotus project was realized, but I knew that one day our enemies would find us.

"A new century began on the Mirror Star, so did the countdown to war.

"But we started from scratch.

· Finale

"Years later, when I returned to the Mirror Star, the words engraved on the Herodotus ship had not disappeared, but represented the original vision of its creators.

"Those whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad. "
