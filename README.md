# Herodotus (In Dev)

Herodotus is a Minecraft modpack mixed magic and technology together, a deep tweaked extreme modpack based on Minecraft 1.12.2, CraftTweaker2 and FTBQuests.

The name "Herodotus" came from a Greek historian. Herodotus recorded half-truths and half-falses in his book "Histories", just like the mix of magic and technology!
